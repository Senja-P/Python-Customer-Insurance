# Python-Customer-Insurance

- The purpose of this study project was to analyse the variables impacting the monthly car insurance payments and use the findings to plan the customer retention program. 

- Data source:  The dataset used in this analysis is an open-source dataset, published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pankajjsh06/ibm-watson-marketing-customer-value-data) in 2018. The link to the original data source, IBM Watson marketing and customer value data, is available in Kaggle page but the original dataset is no longer available. Hence, the data collection methods are unknown. The dataset was used for learning purposes only (in the certified Data Immersion course at CareerFoundry in 2021)

-	The above Python scripts were created for this study project and I used the following tools and libraries; Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, json, pylab, sklearn (e.g Linear Regression, cluster, KMeans)

- The presentation of findings and the summary of the data analysis process is available on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/senja.p8569/viz/CarInsuranceData_16370600838990/CarInsuranceData).
